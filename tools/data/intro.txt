VW(1)                vi whence configuration for bash                    VW(1)

NAME
    vw -- vi whence to edit bash configuration

SYNOPSIS
    vw <variable>

DESCRIPTION
    Invokes vi on the definition of a variable / function in the
    config files.
    
    With no variable, produces this man page.

IMPLEMENTATION
    The INSTALL script tweaks .bashrc to source the vw profile, which
    sources others as per environment.  Has a vw utility that invokes
    vi on the defintiion of the variable wherever it occurs in the
    files living in that directory.  Has hostname and os specific
    config files to facilitate customization.  Uses git to coordinate
    updates between machines.

FEATURES:
    Per machine config.
    Per os config.
    Core sharing of functions.
    Simple partitioning of customization.
    Manageable config files - use vw to edit function definition.
    Minimal home directory clutter.
    Stored in $VW_DIR.
    Bloatware - merge from eric branch to get a bunch of stuff:
        dev.sh    development functions
        dtob.sh   conversions dtob, dtoh, etc.
        ea.sh     convenient shortcuts
        env.sh    environment
        pass.sh   encrypted storage for passwords
        scrap.sh  scrap file
        sd.sh     set directory via nicknames

NOTES:
    Basic idea is to store all config files in a directory. For vw, this
    is VW_DIR, typically ~/vw.

    To use, source the vw profile script in .bahshrc.  This adds the vw
    config stuff provided there.
    
    Subfolders of the vw directory hold config files as follows:
    + base    used everywhefe
    + os      os specific customization, e.g. windows, mac, linux
    + host    machine specific

    The root vw profile sources first base files, then os, finally the
    host specific config.  A tools folder has supporting scripts and
    data.

SETUP
    Run INSTALL on a machine that provides ssh access.  It will print
    the git clone command line to access.

    Use this clone info to set up bash config on your machines.
    Typically,

        git clone <user>@<host>:git_root/vw.git
        bash vw/INSTALL
        exec bash # gets new settings

TRICKS:
    Resolve password conficlts with getpass -m.

    Type vw<tab><tab> to see list of all shared items.

    Enforce ordering of config files with 02 type prefixes.
